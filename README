A simple program to use your numpad as a simple sampler. Did you ever mash up youtube tracks with the numpad like I did?
I enjoyed it so much I created this program to share the joy! :)

usage: python numpadz.py
use numpad to play samples, use + or - to cycle between sample packs.
use * and / to cycle through GIF packs (no script to create gifpacks exist yet, but I've created some bash scripts to rename and 
resize the gifs

requirements: pygame, ffmpeg 

pack builder: (script requires a dict file - by default it uses: /usr/share/dict/cracklib-small - you can modify this in the convert.sh script to solve if you have any issues.)
to build your own sample pack, check the wav folder, add 9 random wavs to the folder and run 'sh createpack.sh'
those wavs will be converted and moved to a folder with a randomly generated name. The pack will automatically be added to Numpadz to play with.

included are some sample packs I have compiled from random free packs (don't sue me please).
